 Python is the most popular language for dealing with artificial intelligence, 
and it almost becomes the only language specialized in this field. Artificial intelligence is 
a huge technological revolution because it offers applications such as machine learning, 
and among the applications of machine language is price prediction. In this project we 
will build an AI neural network model for forecasting stock prices. Specifically, we will 
be working with Elon Musk's famous owner Tesla stock, we will use the TESLA stock 
data set from Yahoo Finance, which contains stock data for ten years. We will make use 
of the Google colab platform to process our data
